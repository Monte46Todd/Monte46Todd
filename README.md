## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a full-stack developer specializing in building and maintaining e-commerce websites using a combination of WordPress, React, and custom APIs. This space showcases a collection of projects that reflect my passion for creating seamless online shopping experiences with strong technical foundations.

My development approach blends the flexibility of WordPress with the interactivity and responsiveness of modern front-end frameworks like React. I enjoy extending WordPress beyond its traditional limits, using it as a powerful CMS and backend system while crafting dynamic, user-focused interfaces with React. Whether it's creating product catalogs, shopping carts, or checkout flows, I focus on delivering fast, intuitive, and accessible experiences.

Custom API development is a key part of my work. I design and integrate APIs that connect various parts of the e-commerce ecosystemâ€”inventory systems, payment gateways, CRMs, and more. This allows for greater flexibility, performance, and control over the user journey. I emphasize clean architecture, secure communication, and scalable design in every API I build or consume.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find components, backend services, and full-stack projects that reflect real-world e-commerce scenarios. From handling product data and user accounts to implementing payment systems and order tracking, each project is built with a focus on usability, performance, and maintainability.

Iâ€™m always exploring new tools and practices to improve the development workflow, from CI/CD automation to headless commerce solutions. I believe in writing clean, modular code and maintaining a user-first mindset throughout the development process.

Thank you for visiting! Feel free to explore the code, open an issue, or connect if you're working on similar projects. I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, and exchanging ideas with others in the e-commerce and development community.
